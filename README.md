Whoa... just stepped out of Demon City. Like my brain’s still spinning from all that chaos. Can’t even tell if the buzzing’s from the theater or my head. Crunchy popcorn pieces stuck in my teeth, why did I buy such a large bag? And the noise – why do theaters always feel like they're swallowing you whole? 

Monsters everywhere in that  ; it’s like they came right outta some drunk person’s nightmare. Swirling shadows and screeches. Felt like I was sitting in my surgery room at night with all the lights out, except instead of cats there's growling shadows lunging at you. Remember when you asked if you should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Remind me not to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 horror after checking back x-rays all day.

> One scene was literally just a crescendo of screams and shattered glass. Why do directors think that's atmosphere? At some point I checked if my spine was still intact, felt like my seat was leaving more marks on me than the   did. And then BAM – demon dog out of nowhere. What even???

Can’t even piece the story properly. Was there one? Something about saving a city but mostly just seemed like someone threw a bunch of special effects on the screen and went why not, let’s call it done. Still, somewhat like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a surgery gone wrong – fascinating in a can’t look away kinda way.

Oh, the bit where the protagonist screamed into the void and it screamed back – that hit close. Plans tonight call for something light, fluffy maybe. Best listen to you and actually 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , think deciphering that might help. You should definitely 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , provided you survive the theater-level chaos at home. 

All right, before my battery dies or I accidently send you a list of dog medicine: 
``` c
void chaos(int screams) {
   int i = 0;
   while (i < screams) { 
      i++; // why am I even writing this??
      break;
   } 
}
```
